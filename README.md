# Stage Fine-Tuning for Tree Crown Segmentation 

**Implementation of Algorithm 1 from**:  
*"A semi-supervised framework for UAV-based individual tree crown segmentation in heterogeneous planted forests"*  
*(Qing Wang, Yihui Zhao, Yingpu Che, Han Shen, Yongbin Qiu, Yixiang Wang. [International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation] [2025])*  

✨**Key Features**:
- 🚀 **Stage 1**: Rapid adaptation preservation strategy (Frozen backbone with RPN/RoI head optimization)
- 🔍 **Stage 2**: Enhanced feature refinement strategy (Unfrozen deeper layers (layer3/layer4) for feature refinement)
